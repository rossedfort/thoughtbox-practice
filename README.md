### Progress

I got through iteration 4, but due to trying to use all jQuery to update the link's status in iteration 3, I ran out of time and was not able to complete it the way I would have liked. Right now it works with a minor bug where sometimes the `Mark as Read` or `Mark as Unread` buttons don't respond to a click without first refreshing the page.
